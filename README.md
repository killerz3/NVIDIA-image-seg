# [Getting Started with Image Segmentation](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+L-FX-04+V2)

This is a simple IPython Notebook created for the Nvidia Deep Learning Institute course on image segmentation.

## Tasks
1. Creating a simple NN for image segmentation (data preprocessing)
2. Using CNN
3. Implementing Dice Metric and parameter search

## Files:
### image segmentation.ipynb:
- Using simple NN for image segmentation (inefficient)
- Using CNN with multiple convolutions and one convolutional transpose layer

### UNET+Dice.ipynb:
- Using the previous CNN with Dice coefficient which provides a better comparison of detected area with the actual area
- Implementing a U-Net architecture with encoder-decoder layers
